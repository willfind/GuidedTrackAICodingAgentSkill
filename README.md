# GuidedTrack AI Coding Agent Skill

Teaches AI coding agents (Claude Code, Codex, and similar) to write, edit, review, push, and debug [GuidedTrack](https://www.guidedtrack.com/) programs correctly. GuidedTrack has many undocumented sharp edges — this skill encodes them (plus tooling for pushing programs and downloading run data) so agents get things right the first time.

## Prerequisites

Claude Code (or another agent framework that supports skills) and git. The push/pull/data features also need a GuidedTrack account — the agent will ask for your email and password when it needs them.

## Install

**Claude Code, all your projects (recommended):**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/willfind/GuidedTrackAICodingAgentSkill.git ~/.claude/skills/guidedtrack-builder
```

**Claude Code, one project only:** clone into `<project>/.claude/skills/guidedtrack-builder` instead (note the `.claude` — skills elsewhere in a project are not discovered). The folder name is cosmetic — the skill's name comes from SKILL.md.

**Codex / other frameworks:** point your framework's skill mechanism at this folder; `agents/openai.yaml` carries the Codex metadata. See your framework's skill docs.

Works on Windows too: the agent drives the `gt` CLI via Git Bash, with details in SKILL.md's Windows notes.

## Use

Nothing to configure — Claude Code loads the skill automatically whenever a task involves GuidedTrack, or invoke it explicitly with `/guidedtrack-builder`. To confirm it's installed, ask Claude "what skills do you have?"

Try it end to end:

> Using the guidedtrack-builder skill, create a 3-question mood survey and push it to GuidedTrack as `zz_skill_smoke_test`

(then delete `zz_skill_smoke_test` from your GuidedTrack account afterward).

## Stay updated

The skill improves regularly — run `git pull` in the cloned folder now and then, or before starting significant GuidedTrack work.

## What's in here

| Path | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `SKILL.md` | Entry point: workflow, validation checklist, pushing to GuidedTrack.com (Mac/Linux/Windows), downloading run data |
| `references/complete_guide.md` | The GuidedTrack language guide: syntax, patterns, keywords, pitfalls |
| `bin/gt` | The GuidedTrack CLI (bash), with portable fixes and an added `pull` subcommand. Optional install: `mkdir -p ~/bin && cp bin/gt ~/bin/gt && chmod +x ~/bin/gt` (needs `jq`; per-OS instructions in SKILL.md) |
| `agents/openai.yaml` | Codex metadata (ignored by Claude Code) |

## Provenance

Merged 2026-07-24 from the original skill, study-recreation additions (Isaac), a Windows adaptation (Greg), and field-tested improvements from building and launching a production research study. Every non-obvious claim is verified against the [official docs](https://docs.guidedtrack.com/) or observed in production.
